# DeepWiki Codebase Wiki 2.0.4

Cross-platform plugin packaging for the original `my-ai-skill/deepwiki-skill` Agent Skill.

This is an additive ChatGPT adapter, not a replacement for the original Skill. The repository's original `.apm/` skill, references, scripts, templates, `workflow-runner` agent, prompt, and manifest remain the backup/source of truth. This feature branch adds this package under `chatgpt-plugin/` and does not modify those originals.

Key upgrades:
- Preserve the six-phase workflow and exact one-phase workflow-runner contract.
- Use native independent page workers in `doc-write` where supported; otherwise execute the same contracts sequentially.
- Keep Mermaid MCP-free: provide a standalone browser preview with Mermaid.js; keep CLI optional for local agents and CI.
- Clearly report actual validation level and runtime capability; never overstate static checks as real rendering.


## Mermaid validation correctness (2.0.4)

- Pipe-delimited flowchart edge labels are unquoted (`A -->|Yes| B`); quoted pipe labels are rejected by static regression lint.
- Static checks are not a Mermaid parser. Runtime outcomes are tri-state: `passed`, `failed`, or `not_run`.
- Mermaid CLI unavailability is reported as `not_run`, never as a diagram syntax failure or a successful validation.
- Phase 4 requires actual Mermaid.js parse/render or Mermaid CLI success for every block before reporting an overall pass.
